# NFL_Champion
First ever machine learning project (using phyton and excel), the goal with this project is create an effective model approach for predicting NFL Champion, right before the playoffs start.

Steps In This Project:

Excel

•	1st: Gather player (offense and defensive) player data and gather team data (advanced, basic, defensive, and offensive team statistics). Data is all pro-football reference.com

•	2nd: Feature engineering (re-created/made new features) create statistics that measure strength of the players on the teams as well as playoff experience of the team.

•	3rd: Create rawdata set, normalize data-set (min/max scale) to use with models.


Phyton

•	1st: Prepare data again (read norm data in, drop data (reasons:)) 

•	2nd: Select and take out certain features

•	3rd: RandomForest Regressor (trial and error based parameters, log results)

•	4th: Export predictions and importance.
