## Project Details

This project builds on my NBA champion prediction project, but much of the data for this NFL project was collected manually over time. 

The project uses machine learning techniques in Python to predict future NFL champions.

### How to Set Up and Run the Project

1. For predicting future seasons (e.g., 2025, 2026), you will need to manually copy the new season data from the websites linked below.
2. Format the data appropriately (using Excel, Python, or other tools) according to the required structure.
3. Run the Python file `nfl_champ_data.py` to load the data.
4. Then run `nfl_champ_ml.py` to generate predictions.
