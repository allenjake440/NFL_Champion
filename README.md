First ever machine learning project (using phyton and excel), the goal with this project is create an effective model approach for the predicting NFL Champion (super-bowl winner), right before the playoffs start. 

Steps In This Project:

_Excel_

•	1st: Gather player (offense and defensive) player data and gather team data (advanced, basic, defensive, and offensive team statistics). Data is all pro-football reference.com

•	2nd: Feature engineering (re-created/made new features) create statistics that measure strength of the players on the teams as well as playoff experience of the team.

•	3rd: Create rawdata, send to juypterlab.


_Pyhton_

•	1st: Prepare data again (read norm data in, drop data (reasons:)) 

•	2nd: Select and take out certain features

•	3rd: RandomForest Regressor (trial and error based parameters, log results)

•	4th: Export predictions and importance.
