> First ever machine learning project (using phyton and excel), the goal with this project is create an effective model approach for the predicting NFL Champion (super-bowl winner), right before the playoffs start. 

### Project Procedure:

## Excel

•	1st: Gather player (offense and defensive) player data and gather team data (advanced, basic, defensive, and offensive team statistics). Data is all pro-football reference.com

•	2nd: Feature engineering (re-created/made new features) create statistics that measure strength of the players on the teams as well as playoff experience of the team.

•	3rd: Create rawdata sets, send to juypterlab.


## Phyton

•	1st: Read in prepare data, scale, drop ceratin rows.

•	2nd: Select and take out certain features, play around with results (check for highly mult corr.)

•	3rd: Use model (different types of regressors). RandomForest best results, log parameter, play around with parameter to find best results.

•	4th: Identify error metrics (average precisions), (mae), to evalute results as a whole.

•	5th: Export predictions and importance.
